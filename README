VIKAASA 0.10.3

ABOUT
    VIKAASA provides a library of functions for GNU Octave or MATLAB(R) for
    working with viability kernels, as well as a graphical user interface for
    MATLAB(R).  For more information, see the manual.

STARTING VIKAASA
    To launch VIKAASA run either `vikaasa' (for the GUI) or `vikaasa_cli'
    (to initialise the library) from within MATLAB(R) or Octave.

COMMAND-LINE EXAMPLES
    % Loading a VIKAASA project:
    project = vk_project_load('filename.mat');

    % Projects are just structs, so you can alter them easily.
    % To alter the discretisation of next kernel to run, and enable
    % parallel processing:
    proj.discretisation = [10; 12];
    proj.use_parallel = 1;

    % Compute a kernel using these settings, and store the result in a
    % new project:
    project2 = vk_kernel_run(project);

    % View the kernel (according to the settings in the project):
    vk_kernel_view(project2);

    % Saving the project to a file:
    vk_project_save(project2, 'filename.mat');

SEE ALSO
    The VIKAASA manual should be considered the most authoritative document.
    It should have been included with this program.

    Type `help <subject>' for any VIKAASA command from within Octave or
    MATLAB(R), as well as any of the following:
